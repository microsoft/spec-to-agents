# Build Multi-Agent Event Planning Workflow Skeleton

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

This document must be maintained in accordance with `specs/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

This specification defines the implementation of a multi-agent workflow skeleton for event planning using the Microsoft Agent Framework. The workflow orchestrates five specialized agents (Event Coordinator, Venue Specialist, Budget Analyst, Catering Coordinator, and Logistics Manager) to collaboratively plan events.

After implementation, users will be able to:
1. Start the DevUI (`uv run devui`) and interact with the event planning workflow
2. Submit an event planning request (e.g., "Plan a corporate holiday party for 50 people with a budget of $5000")
3. Observe the workflow as it coordinates between agents to develop a comprehensive event plan
4. Receive a final, integrated event plan that includes venue recommendations, budget allocation, catering options, and logistics coordination

The workflow follows an orchestrated sequential pattern where the Event Coordinator acts as the primary orchestrator, delegating specialized tasks to other agents and synthesizing their outputs into a coherent plan.

## Surprises & Discoveries

### Import Path Discovery
- **Issue**: Initial implementation used `from agent_framework.core import Workflow, WorkflowBuilder` which caused import errors
- **Resolution**: The correct import is `from agent_framework import Workflow, WorkflowBuilder` (directly from the main package)
- **Impact**: Updated workflow/core.py and test files to use correct imports

### Agent Import Bug
- **Issue**: All agent files were importing from `budget_analyst` prompt instead of their own prompts
- **Resolution**: Fixed imports in event_coordinator.py, venue_specialist.py, catering_coordinator.py, and logistics_manager.py
- **Impact**: Each agent now correctly uses its specialized system prompt

### Workflow Cycle Warning
- **Issue**: DevUI displays a cycle warning: "LogisticsManager -> ... -> EventCoordinator -> LogisticsManager"
- **Context**: This is expected behavior - the EventCoordinator appears at both start and end for synthesis
- **Resolution**: The framework supports cycles and uses max_iterations to prevent infinite loops
- **Impact**: No changes needed; workflow executes successfully despite the warning

### Sequential Execution
- **Discovery**: The workflow executes agents in perfect sequence as designed
- **Observation**: Each agent completes before the next begins (2s, 6s, 10s, 11s, 13s execution times)
- **Validation**: Confirmed through DevUI events panel showing sequential workflow_event.complete messages

### Agent Handoff via `full_conversation` Field
- **Discovery**: WorkflowBuilder handles agent context passing automatically through the `full_conversation` field in `AgentExecutorResponse`
- **Mechanism Details**: When agents are chained with `add_edge(agent1, agent2)`:
  1. Agent1 produces `AgentExecutorResponse` with `full_conversation` = all prior messages + agent1's outputs
  2. Agent2's `from_response()` handler automatically receives this response
  3. Handler loads `full_conversation` into message cache: `self._cache = list(prior.full_conversation)`
  4. Agent2 runs with complete conversation history from workflow start
- **Impact**: No manual context management needed; conversation naturally accumulates through workflow
- **Evidence**: Source code analysis of `agent_framework/_workflows/_agent_executor.py`:
  ```python
  @handler
  async def from_response(self, prior: AgentExecutorResponse, ctx):
      if prior.full_conversation is not None:
          self._cache = list(prior.full_conversation)  # Load complete history
      await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)  # Run with full context
  ```
- **Validation**: 
  - Current workflow implementation correctly leverages this automatic handoff
  - Each agent in the chain sees all previous conversation messages
  - Matches pattern used in framework samples (`getting_started/workflows/`)
- **Spec Update**: D3 and Phase 4 updated to accurately document this mechanism

## Decision Log

### D1: Sequential Orchestration Pattern
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Decision**: Use sequential orchestration with EventCoordinator → VenueSpecialist → BudgetAnalyst → CateringCoordinator → LogisticsManager → EventCoordinator
- **Rationale**: 
  - Matches architecture diagram in AGENTS.md
  - Simplest to implement and debug
  - Allows each agent to build on previous outputs
  - EventCoordinator can synthesize all specialist outputs at the end
- **Alternatives Considered**: Fan-out/fan-in for parallel execution (could be future enhancement)

### D2: Direct Package Imports
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Decision**: Use `from agent_framework import Workflow, WorkflowBuilder` instead of `from agent_framework.core`
- **Rationale**: Matches the framework's public API pattern and existing codebase usage
- **Impact**: Consistent with agents/__init__.py which uses `from agent_framework import ChatAgent, Workflow`

### D3: Conversation History for Context Passing
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Decision**: Use conversation history for context passing between agents
- **Rationale**: 
  - Simplest approach
  - Leverages Agent Framework's built-in message passing
  - No need for SharedState or Pydantic models initially
- **Future Enhancement**: Could add SharedState with Pydantic models if structured data passing is needed

### D4: System Prompt Design
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Decision**: Each system prompt includes role definition, responsibilities, collaboration context, output format, constraints, and handoff guidance
- **Rationale**: Provides agents with clear expectations and structured output formats for effective collaboration
- **Impact**: Agents produce well-formatted, contextual responses that build on each other

### D5: Agent Handoff Mechanism via WorkflowBuilder
- **Date**: 2025-10-27 (Updated after deep research)
- **Decision**: Use WorkflowBuilder with `add_edge()` for sequential agent chaining; rely on automatic context passing via `full_conversation` field in `AgentExecutorResponse`
- **Rationale**: 
  - WorkflowBuilder automatically handles context passing through `AgentExecutorResponse.full_conversation`
  - Each agent's `from_response()` handler receives complete conversation history from workflow start
  - No manual message passing, context threading, or state management required
  - Framework ensures zero context loss between agent handoffs via type-based handler routing
  - Simpler and more maintainable than manual context management
- **Research Evidence**:
  - Examined `agent_framework/_workflows/_agent_executor.py` source code
  - Confirmed `from_response()` handler loads `prior.full_conversation` into agent cache before execution
  - Validated that `full_conversation` field accumulates: `list(cache_messages) + list(response.messages)`
  - Pattern matches samples in `third_party/agent-framework/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/`
  - DeepWiki documentation confirms sequential pattern uses automatic context passing
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - HandoffBuilder with tool-based routing (rejected: adds complexity for deterministic sequential workflow)
  - Manual SharedState management (rejected: unnecessary when conversation history suffices)
- **Impact**: Current workflow implementation is correct; spec updated to accurately document the automatic handoff mechanism

### D6: User Handoff Integration Pattern (UPDATED)
- **Date**: 2025-10-27 (Updated 2025-10-28)
- **Decision**: Use tool-based approach with custom executor wrappers to enable optional user elicitation by any specialist agent
- **Rationale**:
  - **Reliability**: Tool calls provide programmatic detection of user input needs (agents cannot directly emit RequestInfoMessage)
  - **Framework Native**: Leverages Agent Framework's built-in `RequestInfoExecutor` and `RequestInfoEvent` mechanisms
  - **DevUI Integration**: DevUI automatically handles `RequestInfoEvent`s, no custom UI needed
  - **Minimal Disruption**: Preserves existing sequential workflow structure
  - **Agent Autonomy**: Agents call `request_user_input` tool when clarification needed
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Workflow can run without user input if agents don't call the tool
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Marker-Based Detection**: Parse agent text responses for markers like "REQUEST_USER_INPUT:" (rejected: unreliable, requires complex parsing)
  - **Structured Output Parsing**: Agents output JSON for user requests (rejected: requires valid JSON production, error-prone)
  - **Tool-Based Pattern**: Give agents "request_user_input" tool (✅ SELECTED: most reliable, clear agent interface)
  - **Prompt-Only Approach**: Agents instructed to request input via prompts (rejected: agents cannot emit RequestInfoMessage directly)
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create `request_user_input` tool that agents can call
  - Implement `HumanInLoopAgentExecutor` custom wrappers to intercept tool calls
  - Wrappers detect `request_user_input` in `FunctionCallContent` and emit `UserElicitationRequest`
  - Add bidirectional edges between HITL wrappers and shared `RequestInfoExecutor`
- **Impact**:
  - Requires new `UserElicitationRequest` message type (single general-purpose type)
  - Requires `request_user_input` tool definition
  - Requires `HumanInLoopAgentExecutor` custom executor class
  - Workflow builder needs HITL wrappers and bidirectional edges to RequestInfoExecutor
  - Agent prompts need guidance on when/how to use the tool
  - Tests need to handle RequestInfoEvent scenarios and tool call detection
- **Research Sources**:
  - `third_party/agent-framework/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/human-in-the-loop/guessing_game_with_human_input.py`
  - `third_party/agent-framework/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/agents/workflow_as_agent_human_in_the_loop.py`
  - `azure_chat_agents_tool_calls_with_feedback.py` for DraftFeedbackCoordinator pattern
  - DeepWiki documentation on RequestInfoExecutor, FunctionCallContent, and human-in-the-loop patterns

```

**Code Quality**: ✅ Clean
- Linting: `ruff check` - All checks passed
- Formatting: `ruff format` - 1 file reformatted, all others compliant

### What Worked Well

1. **System Prompt Design**: Comprehensive prompts with clear role definitions and output formats enabled effective agent collaboration
2. **Sequential Pattern**: Simple sequential orchestration made the workflow easy to understand and debug
3. **DevUI Integration**: The workflow was immediately discoverable and testable in DevUI without additional configuration
4. **Framework Maturity**: Agent Framework Python implementation handled workflow construction smoothly
5. **Incremental Testing**: Unit tests validated construction before integration testing

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Cycle Handling**: The workflow creates a cycle (EventCoordinator at start and end) which triggers a warning. Could explore alternative patterns:
   - Use a separate "Synthesizer" executor instead of returning to EventCoordinator
   - Use conditional edges to determine when to terminate
   - Set explicit `max_iterations` limit on WorkflowBuilder

2. **Integration Tests**: Current integration tests require Azure credentials and make real API calls
   - Could add mocked versions for faster CI/CD pipelines
   - Could use pytest fixtures to share workflow instances

3. **Output Validation**: Integration tests check for keywords but don't validate structured output
   - Could add Pydantic models for each agent's output
   - Could validate that final synthesis includes all specialist sections

4. **Error Handling**: Current implementation doesn't include retry logic or fallback strategies
   - Future enhancement for production readiness

### Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 11 total
  - 5 system prompts updated
  - 4 agent imports fixed
  - 1 workflow created
  - 1 module export updated
- **Files Created**: 2 test files
- **Lines of Code**: ~500 lines (prompts + workflow + tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 3 unit tests, 3 integration tests
- **Development Time**: ~1 hour (from spec to validated implementation)
- **Test Execution Time**: Unit tests <5s, DevUI workflow ~15-20s

### Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Tool Integration**: Add tools for each specialist (venue search APIs, budget calculators, etc.)
2. **Shared State Models**: Implement Pydantic models for structured data passing between agents
3. **Parallel Execution**: Explore fan-out pattern for independent specialists (venue + budget could run in parallel)
4. ~~**Human-in-the-Loop**: Add approval gates for budget or venue selection~~ **→ NOW IN PROGRESS (see new Phase 6 below)**
5. **Memory Integration**: Use Mem0 for learning from past events and improving recommendations
6. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic, fallback strategies, and graceful degradation
7. **Workflow Termination**: Add explicit termination conditions or max_iterations configuration
8. **Output Standardization**: Define Pydantic schemas for agent outputs to enable better synthesis

### Acceptance Criteria Review

**Specification Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Context and Orientation

### Current State

The project currently has:
- **Five agent files** under `src/spec2agent/agents/`:
  - `event_coordinator.py`
  - `venue_specialist.py`
  - `budget_analyst.py`
  - `catering_coordinator.py`
  - `logistics_manager.py`
- **Basic agent definitions** that use `get_chat_client().create_agent()`
- **Agent export mechanism** in `src/spec2agent/agents/__init__.py` with `export_entities()` function for DevUI discovery
- **Placeholder system prompts** in `src/spec2agent/prompts/*.py` (all currently "You are a helpful assistant")
- **Shared client code** in `src/spec2agent/clients.py` providing `get_chat_client()` and `get_credential()`
- **Empty workflow module** at `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py`

### Architecture Overview

Based on the workflow architecture diagram in AGENTS.md, the system follows this pattern:

1. **User Input** → **Event Coordinator** (Orchestrator)
2. **Event Coordinator** → Delegates to specialists:
   - **Venue Specialist**: Researches and recommends venues
   - **Budget Analyst**: Manages costs and financial constraints
   - **Catering Coordinator**: Handles food and beverage planning
   - **Logistics Manager**: Coordinates schedules and resources
3. **Event Coordinator** → Synthesizes outputs → **Final Event Plan**

### Technology Stack

- **Agent Framework Core**: Multi-agent orchestration primitives
- **Agent Framework Azure AI**: `AzureAIAgentClient` for Azure AI Foundry integration
- **Agent Framework DevUI**: Web interface for testing workflows
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern Python features

### Key Framework Concepts

- **ChatAgent**: Individual agent with instructions (system prompt) and optional tools
- **WorkflowBuilder**: Constructs multi-agent workflows by adding agents and defining edges
- **AgentExecutor**: Wraps agents in the workflow execution context
- **Workflow.as_agent()**: Allows workflows to be exposed as single agents for composition

## Plan of Work

### Phase 1: System Prompt Design

Design comprehensive, role-specific system prompts for each of the five agents that enable effective collaboration in an orchestrated workflow.

**Event Coordinator Prompt** (`src/spec2agent/prompts/event_coordinator.py`):
- Define role as the primary orchestrator
- Specify responsibilities: gather requirements, delegate to specialists, synthesize results
- Include guidance on how to structure delegation messages
- Define output format for the final integrated event plan

**Venue Specialist Prompt** (`src/spec2agent/prompts/venue_specialist.py`):
- Define role as venue research and recommendation specialist
- Specify considerations: capacity, location, amenities, accessibility
- Define output format for venue recommendations (structured list with pros/cons)

**Budget Analyst Prompt** (`src/spec2agent/prompts/budget_analyst.py`):
- Define role as financial planning and cost management specialist
- Specify responsibilities: budget allocation, cost estimation, financial constraints
- Define output format for budget breakdowns (categorized allocation)

**Catering Coordinator Prompt** (`src/spec2agent/prompts/catering_coordinator.py`):
- Define role as food and beverage planning specialist
- Specify considerations: dietary restrictions, cuisine types, service style
- Define output format for catering recommendations

**Logistics Manager Prompt** (`src/spec2agent/prompts/logistics_manager.py`):
- Define role as scheduling and resource coordination specialist
- Specify responsibilities: timeline creation, vendor coordination, equipment needs
- Define output format for logistics plans

### Phase 2: Workflow Architecture Design

Design the workflow structure that implements the orchestration pattern shown in the architecture diagram.

**Workflow Pattern Decision**:

The Agent Framework Python package provides two primary orchestration builders:

1. **WorkflowBuilder** (Graph-Based Sequential/Parallel):
   - Use `add_edge(source, target)` to create deterministic flows
   - Context automatically passes via `full_conversation` field in `AgentExecutorResponse`
   - Supports sequential chains, fan-out/fan-in, and conditional routing
   - Best for predictable, structured workflows
   - ✅ **CHOSEN for event planning workflow**

2. **HandoffBuilder** (Dynamic Agent Routing):
   - Agents invoke `handoff_to_<agent>` tool calls to transfer control
   - Coordinator dynamically selects which specialist to engage based on conversation content
   - Best for triage/support scenarios where routing depends on runtime decisions
   - Not needed for our deterministic sequential planning workflow

**Selected Approach**: WorkflowBuilder with Sequential Chaining
- Matches the architecture diagram exactly
- Simplest to implement and reason about
- Automatic context passing between all agents via `full_conversation` field
- Deterministic execution order enables predictable planning process
- Event Coordinator can synthesize all specialist outputs at the end

**Workflow Structure** (`src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py`):
- Create `build_event_planning_workflow()` function
- Initialize all five agents using their respective system prompts
- Use `WorkflowBuilder` to construct the workflow:
  - Set Event Coordinator as start executor
  - Add edges: Event Coordinator → Venue Specialist → Budget Analyst → Catering Coordinator → Logistics Manager → Event Coordinator (synthesis)
  - Configure Event Coordinator with `output_response=True` for final output
- Return `Workflow` instance

### Phase 3: Module Structure Updates

Update the agent module structure to align with DevUI discovery requirements.

**Agent Export Pattern** (per AGENTS.md):
The `src/spec2agent/agents/__init__.py` module uses an `export_entities()` function that returns a list of all agents/workflows for DevUI discovery.

**Workflow Integration**:
- Create a workflow variable in `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py` that builds the complete event planning workflow
- Import and add the workflow to the `export_entities()` list in `src/spec2agent/agents/__init__.py`
- This makes the workflow discoverable alongside individual agents in DevUI

**Individual Agent Files**:
- Keep existing agent files (`event_coordinator.py`, `venue_specialist.py`, etc.)
- These remain available for standalone testing and as building blocks for the workflow
- Already exported via `export_entities()` for individual DevUI testing

### Phase 4: Understanding Agent Handoff in WorkflowBuilder

Understand the technical mechanism that enables automatic context passing between agents in the workflow.

**Automatic Context Passing via `full_conversation`**:

The Agent Framework WorkflowBuilder automatically handles context passing between agents through the `full_conversation` field in `AgentExecutorResponse`. When agents are chained via `add_edge(agent1, agent2)`:

**Step 1 - Agent1 Execution**:
```python
# AgentExecutor runs agent1 with current messages
response = await agent1.run(cache_messages, thread=agent_thread)

# Creates full conversation snapshot
full_conversation = list(cache_messages) + list(response.messages)

# Sends AgentExecutorResponse to next agent
await ctx.send_message(AgentExecutorResponse(
    executor_id="agent1",
    agent_run_response=response,
    full_conversation=full_conversation  # Complete history!
))
```

**Step 2 - Agent2 Reception**:
```python
# Agent2's from_response handler automatically receives prior response
@handler
async def from_response(self, prior: AgentExecutorResponse, ctx):
    # Load complete conversation history into cache
    if prior.full_conversation is not None:
        self._cache = list(prior.full_conversation)
    # Run agent2 with full context from workflow start
    await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)
```

**Result**: Each agent in the chain sees the entire conversation history from the workflow's start, enabling natural context-aware collaboration without manual message passing.

**Key Benefits**:
- No manual context management required
- Conversation history automatically accumulates through the workflow
- Each agent sees all prior user messages and agent outputs
- No context loss between handoffs

**Alternative Patterns (Not Required)**:
- `SharedState` with Pydantic models for structured state machines
- `HandoffBuilder` for dynamic routing via tool calls
- Custom executors for advanced message transformation

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing

Create tests and validation for the workflow.

**Unit Tests** (`tests/test_workflow.py`):
- Test workflow construction (no errors during build)
- Mock agent responses to test flow
- Validate that all agents are included in the workflow
- Test edge definitions

**Integration Tests** (`tests/test_workflow_integration.py`):
- Test full workflow execution with real AI Foundry calls (requires .env)
- Provide sample event planning requests
- Validate that final output includes contributions from all specialists
- Test error handling and edge cases

**DevUI Validation**:
- Start DevUI: `uv run devui`
- Navigate to Event Coordinator workflow
- Submit test requests
- Validate agent interactions and final outputs

### Phase 6: Human-in-the-Loop User Handoff (NEW)

Integrate user elicitation capabilities into the workflow to enable agents to request clarification or approval when needed.

**Background**: 
Based on research into the Agent Framework's human-in-the-loop capabilities, the framework provides `RequestInfoExecutor` as a workflow-native mechanism for pausing execution, requesting user input, and resuming with the user's response. DevUI automatically handles `RequestInfoEvent`s by prompting the user and sending responses back to the workflow.

**Design Decision**:
Use **Custom Executor Wrapper Pattern** where specialist agents can conditionally request user input through a shared `RequestInfoExecutor`. This keeps the core workflow structure intact while adding flexible user interaction points.

**Architecture Changes**:

1. **Add RequestInfoExecutor to Workflow**
   - Create a shared `RequestInfoExecutor` instance
   - Add bidirectional edges between each specialist and the RequestInfoExecutor
   - This allows any agent to pause and request user input when needed

2. **Create Custom RequestInfoMessage Types** (`src/spec2agent/workflow/messages.py`):
   ```python
   from dataclasses import dataclass
   from agent_framework import RequestInfoMessage
   
   @dataclass
   class UserElicitationRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
       """General-purpose request for user input during event planning."""
       prompt: str  # Question to ask the user
       context: dict  # Contextual information (e.g., venue options, budget breakdown)
       request_type: str  # "venue_selection", "budget_approval", "catering_approval", etc.
   
   # Optional: Specialized request types for stronger typing
   @dataclass
   class VenueSelectionRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
       prompt: str
       venue_options: list[dict]  # Structured venue recommendations
       
   @dataclass
   class BudgetApprovalRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
       prompt: str
       proposed_budget: dict  # Budget breakdown by category
   ```

3. **Create Custom Specialist Executors** (`src/spec2agent/workflow/executors.py`):
   - Wrap AgentExecutor instances with custom logic
   - Add handlers to check agent responses for signals requiring user input
   - Send `UserElicitationRequest` to `RequestInfoExecutor` when needed
   - Handle `RequestResponse` and forward to next agent
   
   Example structure:
   ```python
   class VenueSpecialistExecutor(Executor):
       def __init__(self, agent, request_info_id: str):
           self.agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent)
           self.request_info_id = request_info_id
           
       @handler
       async def process(self, request: AgentExecutorRequest, ctx):
           # Run agent
           response = await self.agent_executor.run(request)
           
           # Check if user input needed (parse agent response)
           if self._needs_user_selection(response):
               # Request user input
               await ctx.send_message(
                   VenueSelectionRequest(
                       prompt="Please select your preferred venue",
                       venue_options=self._extract_venues(response)
                   ),
                   target_id=self.request_info_id
               )
           else:
               # Continue to next agent
               await ctx.send_message(response)
   ```

4. **Update Workflow Builder** (`src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py`):
   ```python
   # Add RequestInfoExecutor
   request_info = RequestInfoExecutor(id="user_input")
   
   # Create custom executors (or keep simple AgentExecutors if logic in prompts)
   venue_exec = AgentExecutor(agent=venue, id="venue")
   budget_exec = AgentExecutor(agent=budget, id="budget")
   # ... other agents
   
   # Build workflow with bidirectional edges to RequestInfoExecutor
   workflow = (
       WorkflowBuilder()
       .set_start_executor(coordinator)
       .add_edge(coordinator, venue_exec)
       .add_edge(venue_exec, request_info)      # Venue can request input
       .add_edge(request_info, venue_exec)      # Input flows back to venue
       .add_edge(venue_exec, budget_exec)       # Venue continues to budget
       .add_edge(budget_exec, request_info)     # Budget can request input
       .add_edge(request_info, budget_exec)     # Input flows back to budget
       .add_edge(budget_exec, catering_exec)
       # ... continue pattern for all specialists
       .build()
   )
   ```

5. **Update Agent Prompts with User Elicitation Guidance**:
   Each specialist prompt should include guidance on when to request user input:
   
   ```
   When to request user clarification:
   - If event requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
   - If you need the user to make a selection between options
   - If you need approval for significant decisions (e.g., budget allocation)
   
   To request user input:
   - Clearly state what information you need
   - Provide context and options if applicable
   - Use structured format for easy user response
   
   After receiving user input:
   - Acknowledge the user's choice
   - Incorporate their input into your recommendations
   - Continue with your analysis
   ```

**Workflow Execution Flow with User Handoff**:
```
User Input: "Plan a corporate party for 50 people, budget $5000"
    ↓
EventCoordinator: Analyzes requirements, delegates to specialists
    ↓
VenueSpecialist: Researches 3 venue options
    ↓
RequestInfoExecutor: "Please select preferred venue: A, B, or C?"
    ⏸ WORKFLOW PAUSES (DevUI prompts user)
    ↓
User: Selects "Venue B"
    ↓
RequestInfoExecutor: Sends response back to workflow
    ↓
VenueSpecialist: Confirms selection, provides details
    ↓
BudgetAnalyst: Creates budget allocation
    ↓
RequestInfoExecutor: "Approve this budget breakdown? [details]"
    ⏸ WORKFLOW PAUSES
    ↓
User: Approves or modifies
    ↓
[Continue through catering, logistics, final synthesis]
```

**DevUI Integration**:
- DevUI automatically detects `RequestInfoEvent` emissions
- Displays user-friendly prompts based on `RequestInfoMessage.prompt`
- Captures user responses via UI forms/inputs
- Sends `RequestResponse` back to workflow
- Workflow resumes automatically

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit tests**: Mock `RequestInfoExecutor` and validate message routing
- **Integration tests**: Use pre-supplied responses to test pause/resume without manual input
- **Manual DevUI tests**: Validate actual user interaction flows

**Key Design Principles**:
1. **Optional User Interaction**: Agents decide when user input is needed, not hardcoded
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Workflow can run without user input if agents have sufficient context
3. **Clear Communication**: User prompts are explicit and provide necessary context
4. **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic/dataclass for RequestInfoMessage types
5. **Minimal Code Changes**: Leverage framework's built-in capabilities rather than custom implementation

## Concrete Steps

### Step 1: Design and Implement System Prompts

Navigate to the project root and update each system prompt file:

    cd c:\Users\alexlavaee\source\repos\spec-to-agents

Update `src/spec2agent/prompts/event_coordinator.py`:
- Define Event Coordinator as orchestrator role
- Include delegation strategy
- Specify synthesis approach for final plan

Update `src/spec2agent/prompts/venue_specialist.py`:
- Define Venue Specialist role and expertise
- Specify venue evaluation criteria
- Define recommendation format

Update `src/spec2agent/prompts/budget_analyst.py`:
- Define Budget Analyst role and expertise
- Specify budget breakdown categories
- Define allocation format

Update `src/spec2agent/prompts/catering_coordinator.py`:
- Define Catering Coordinator role and expertise
- Specify catering considerations
- Define recommendation format

Update `src/spec2agent/prompts/logistics_manager.py`:
- Define Logistics Manager role and expertise
- Specify coordination responsibilities
- Define logistics plan format

### Step 2: Implement Workflow Builder

Create the workflow builder in `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py`.

**Understanding the Handoff Flow**:

The workflow uses `add_edge()` to chain agents sequentially. Each edge automatically handles context passing via the `full_conversation` field:

```python
# Edge from EventCoordinator → VenueSpecialist
.add_edge(coordinator, venue)
```

What happens during this edge:
1. User sends: "Plan a corporate party for 50 people"
2. EventCoordinator processes request, outputs planning guidance
3. Framework creates `AgentExecutorResponse` with:
   - `agent_run_response.messages`: Coordinator's output messages
   - `full_conversation`: [User message, Coordinator messages]
4. VenueSpecialist's `from_response()` handler receives this response
5. VenueSpecialist loads `full_conversation` into cache and runs
6. VenueSpecialist sees both user's original request AND coordinator's guidance
7. VenueSpecialist responds with venue recommendations
8. Framework updates: `full_conversation` = [User, Coordinator, VenueSpecialist]
9. Process repeats for each subsequent agent in the chain

**Expected Implementation Structure**:

    from agent_framework.core import WorkflowBuilder
    from spec2agent.clients import get_chat_client
    from spec2agent.prompts import (
        event_coordinator,
        venue_specialist,
        budget_analyst,
        catering_coordinator,
        logistics_manager,
    )

    def build_event_planning_workflow():
        """Build the event planning multi-agent workflow."""
        client = get_chat_client()
        
        # Create agents
        coordinator = client.create_agent(
            name="EventCoordinator",
            instructions=event_coordinator.SYSTEM_PROMPT,
            store=True
        )
        
        # ... create other agents ...
        
        # Build workflow
        workflow = (
            WorkflowBuilder()
            .add_agent(coordinator, id="coordinator", output_response=True)
            .add_agent(venue_agent, id="venue")
            .add_agent(budget_agent, id="budget")
            .add_agent(catering_agent, id="catering")
            .add_agent(logistics_agent, id="logistics")
            .set_start_executor(coordinator)
            .add_edge(coordinator, venue_agent)
            .add_edge(venue_agent, budget_agent)
            .add_edge(budget_agent, catering_agent)
            .add_edge(catering_agent, logistics_agent)
            .add_edge(logistics_agent, coordinator)
            .build()
        )
        
        return workflow

### Step 3: Update Agent Module Exports

Update `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py` to export the workflow as a module-level variable:

    from agent_framework.core import WorkflowBuilder, Workflow
    from spec2agent.clients import get_chat_client
    from spec2agent.prompts import (
        event_coordinator,
        venue_specialist,
        budget_analyst,
        catering_coordinator,
        logistics_manager,
    )

    def build_event_planning_workflow() -> Workflow:
        """Build the event planning multi-agent workflow."""
        # ... implementation ...
        return workflow

    # Export workflow instance for DevUI discovery
    workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()

Update `src/spec2agent/agents/__init__.py` to include the workflow in exports:

    from agent_framework import ChatAgent, Workflow

    from spec2agent.agents.budget_analyst import agent as budget_analyst_agent
    from spec2agent.agents.catering_coordinator import agent as catering_coordinator_agent
    from spec2agent.agents.event_coordinator import agent as event_coordinator_agent
    from spec2agent.agents.logistics_manager import agent as logistics_manager_agent
    from spec2agent.agents.venue_specialist import agent as venue_specialist_agent
    from spec2agent.workflow.core import workflow as event_planning_workflow

    def export_entities() -> list[Workflow | ChatAgent]:
        """Export all agents/workflows for registration in DevUI."""
        return [
            budget_analyst_agent,
            catering_coordinator_agent,
            event_coordinator_agent,
            logistics_manager_agent,
            venue_specialist_agent,
            event_planning_workflow,  # Add workflow to exports
        ]

This makes the workflow discoverable by DevUI alongside individual agents.

### Step 4: Create Tests

Create `tests/test_workflow.py`:

    import pytest
    from spec2agent.workflow.core import build_event_planning_workflow

    def test_workflow_builds_successfully():
        """Test that the workflow can be constructed without errors."""
        workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()
        assert workflow is not None

    def test_workflow_has_all_agents():
        """Test that all five agents are included in the workflow."""
        workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()
        # Add assertions to check agent presence

Create `tests/test_workflow_integration.py`:

    import pytest
    from spec2agent.workflow.core import build_event_planning_workflow

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_workflow_execution():
        """Test full workflow execution with sample request."""
        workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()
        
        # Submit test request
        request = "Plan a corporate holiday party for 50 people with a $5000 budget"
        
        # Execute workflow
        result = await workflow.run(request)
        
        # Validate result contains expected sections
        assert "venue" in result.lower()
        assert "budget" in result.lower()
        assert "catering" in result.lower()
        assert "logistics" in result.lower()

Run tests:

    uv run pytest tests/test_workflow.py
    uv run pytest tests/test_workflow_integration.py

Expected output: All tests pass, confirming workflow construction and execution.

### Step 5: Validate in DevUI

Start the DevUI:

    uv run devui

Expected output:

    Starting Agent Framework DevUI...
    Server running at http://localhost:8000
    Open your browser to interact with agents

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in browser.

Expected behavior:
- DevUI loads successfully
- Event Coordinator workflow appears in the workflow list
- Can select workflow and submit test requests
- Workflow executes and shows agent interactions
- Final response includes integrated event plan

Test with sample request:

    Input: "Plan a team building event for 30 people in Seattle with a budget of $3000"
    
    Expected flow:
    1. Event Coordinator receives request
    2. Venue Specialist provides Seattle venue options
    3. Budget Analyst allocates $3000 across categories
    4. Catering Coordinator suggests food options
    5. Logistics Manager creates timeline
    6. Event Coordinator synthesizes final plan

## Validation and Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria

The workflow skeleton implementation is complete when:

1. **System Prompts**: All five system prompts are comprehensive, role-specific, and enable effective collaboration
2. **Workflow Builder**: `build_event_planning_workflow()` successfully constructs a workflow with all five agents
3. **Module Structure**: Event Coordinator module exports `workflow` variable discoverable by DevUI
4. **Unit Tests**: `test_workflow.py` passes, confirming workflow construction
5. **Integration Tests**: `test_workflow_integration.py` passes, confirming end-to-end execution
6. **DevUI Validation**: Workflow appears in DevUI, accepts requests, orchestrates agents, and produces integrated output

### Observable Behaviors

**Unit Test Output**:

    $ uv run pytest tests/test_workflow.py -v
    
    tests/test_workflow.py::test_workflow_builds_successfully PASSED
    tests/test_workflow.py::test_workflow_has_all_agents PASSED
    
    ========== 2 passed in 1.23s ==========

**Integration Test Output**:

    $ uv run pytest tests/test_workflow_integration.py -v
    
    tests/test_workflow_integration.py::test_workflow_execution PASSED
    
    ========== 1 passed in 5.67s ==========

**DevUI Interaction**:

User submits: "Plan a corporate holiday party for 50 people with a budget of $5000"

Expected final response structure:

    # Corporate Holiday Party Plan

    ## Venue Recommendation
    [Venue Specialist output: venue options with capacity, location, cost]

    ## Budget Allocation
    [Budget Analyst output: categorized budget breakdown totaling $5000]

    ## Catering Plan
    [Catering Coordinator output: menu options, service style, dietary accommodations]

    ## Logistics & Timeline
    [Logistics Manager output: event timeline, vendor coordination, equipment needs]

    ## Summary
    [Event Coordinator synthesis: integrated recommendations and next steps]

### Step 6: Implement User Handoff Support (NEW)

This step adds human-in-the-loop capabilities to the workflow, allowing agents to request user clarification, approval, or selection during execution.

**6.1: Create RequestInfoMessage Types**

Create `src/spec2agent/workflow/messages.py`:

```python
# Copyright (c) Microsoft. All rights reserved.

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any

from agent_framework import RequestInfoMessage

@dataclass
class UserElicitationRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
    """General-purpose request for user input during event planning.
    
    This message type allows any specialist agent to request clarification,
    approval, or selection from the user during workflow execution.
    """
    prompt: str  # Question or instruction for the user
    context: dict[str, Any]  # Contextual information (options, data, etc.)
    request_type: str  # Category: "venue_selection", "budget_approval", etc.

# Optional: Specialized request types for stronger typing
@dataclass
class VenueSelectionRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
    """Request user to select preferred venue from options."""
    prompt: str
    venue_options: list[dict[str, Any]]

@dataclass
class BudgetApprovalRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
    """Request user approval or modification of budget allocation."""
    prompt: str
    proposed_budget: dict[str, float]
    
@dataclass
class CateringApprovalRequest(RequestInfoMessage):
    """Request user approval of catering menu and dietary considerations."""
    prompt: str
    menu_options: list[dict[str, Any]]
    dietary_considerations: list[str]

__all__ = [
    "UserElicitationRequest",
    "VenueSelectionRequest", 
    "BudgetApprovalRequest",
    "CateringApprovalRequest",
]
```

Expected output: Message types are defined and can be imported by workflow and executors.

**6.2: Update Workflow Builder with RequestInfoExecutor**

Modify `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py` to integrate RequestInfoExecutor with bidirectional edges. This allows any agent to optionally request user input while maintaining the sequential flow.

Key changes:
- Add `RequestInfoExecutor` import and instantiation
- Add bidirectional edges between each specialist and the RequestInfoExecutor
- Document that user handoff is optional (agents decide when needed)

Expected output: Workflow builds successfully with RequestInfoExecutor integrated.

**Note**: This is a **prompt-based approach** where agents are instructed via system prompts when to request user input. If agents don't naturally trigger user elicitation through prompts alone, a second phase would involve creating custom executor wrappers with programmatic logic to detect when user input is needed.

**6.3: Update Agent Prompts with User Elicitation Guidance**

For each specialist prompt, add a section on user interaction guidelines. Example additions:

```
**User Interaction Guidelines**:
When you need user input (clarification, selection, or approval):
- Identify what specific information you need from the user
- Formulate a clear, concise question
- Provide relevant context and options
- Use structured format for easy user response

Examples of when to request user input:
- [Domain-specific scenarios where input is valuable]

After receiving user input:
- Acknowledge their response
- Incorporate their choice/clarification into your recommendations
- Continue with your analysis based on the updated information

**Important**: Only request user input when truly necessary. Make reasonable assumptions when requirements are clear.
```

Apply to: `venue_specialist.py`, `budget_analyst.py`, `catering_coordinator.py`, `logistics_manager.py`

**6.4: Create Tests for User Handoff**

Add `tests/test_workflow_user_handoff.py`:

```python
import pytest
from spec2agent.workflow.core import build_event_planning_workflow
from agent_framework import RequestInfoEvent, WorkflowOutputEvent

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_workflow_handles_user_handoff():
    """Test that workflow can handle user handoff scenarios."""
    workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()
    
    # Run with ambiguous request that may trigger user elicitation
    events = [event async for event in workflow.run_stream("Plan a party for 30 people")]
    
    # Check for RequestInfoEvents (user prompts) - may or may not occur
    request_events = [e for e in events if isinstance(e, RequestInfoEvent)]
    
    # Validate workflow can complete
    output_events = [e for e in events if isinstance(e, WorkflowOutputEvent)]
    assert len(output_events) >= 0  # Should produce output regardless

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_workflow_without_user_interaction():
    """Test that workflow completes without user interaction given detailed context."""
    workflow = build_event_planning_workflow()
    
    # Provide comprehensive request
    detailed_request = """
    Plan a corporate team building event:
    - 30 people
    - Budget: $3000
    - Location: Downtown Seattle
    - Dietary: vegetarian and gluten-free options required
    - Date: 3 weeks from now, Friday evening
    """
    
    events = [event async for event in workflow.run_stream(detailed_request)]
    
    # Should complete without requiring user input
    output_events = [e for e in events if isinstance(e, WorkflowOutputEvent)]
    assert len(output_events) > 0
```

Run tests:

    uv run pytest tests/test_workflow_user_handoff.py -v

Expected output: Tests pass, confirming workflow handles scenarios with and without user interaction.

**6.5: Validate in DevUI**

Start DevUI and test user handoff:

    uv run devui

Test scenarios:
1. **Ambiguous request that may require user input**:
   - Submit: "Plan an event for 40 people"
   - If agents request clarification, DevUI should display prompt
   - Provide response via DevUI
   - Workflow should resume and complete

2. **Detailed request without user interaction**:
   - Submit comprehensive event details
   - Workflow should complete without requesting user input

Expected behavior:
- DevUI automatically handles `RequestInfoEvent`s when agents emit them
- User can provide responses via DevUI interface
- Workflow pauses during user input, resumes after response
- Final output incorporates user decisions

## Idempotence and Recovery

### Safe Execution

- Workflow construction is stateless and can be called multiple times
- Agent creation uses consistent names and instructions
- Tests can be run repeatedly without side effects
- DevUI can be restarted without data loss (agents recreated on demand)

### Error Recovery

**If workflow construction fails**:
- Check agent client initialization in `clients.py`
- Validate Azure credentials: `az login` or check Managed Identity
- Verify environment variables in `.env` (if needed)
- Check Agent Framework package versions: `uv run pip list | grep agent-framework`

**If tests fail**:
- Ensure `.env` file exists with correct Azure AI Foundry configuration
- Validate network connectivity to Azure AI services
- Check test assertions match actual workflow structure
- Run tests with increased verbosity: `uv run pytest -vv`

**If DevUI doesn't show workflow**:
- Verify `src/spec2agent/agents/event_coordinator/__init__.py` exports `workflow`
- Check for Python syntax errors: `uv run ruff check src/`
- Restart DevUI: `uv run devui`
- Check DevUI console for discovery errors

### Rollback Strategy

To revert changes:
- System prompts: Restore placeholder prompts if needed
- Workflow code: Remove `workflow/core.py` implementation
- Module exports: Remove workflow export from `__init__.py`
- Tests: Delete or skip new test files

## Artifacts and Notes

### Key Design Decisions

**Sequential vs. Parallel Orchestration**:
- **Decision**: Use sequential orchestration with Event Coordinator as primary orchestrator
- **Rationale**: Matches architecture diagram, simpler to implement and debug, allows each agent to build on previous outputs
- **Alternative**: Fan-out/fan-in for parallel specialist execution (could be future enhancement)

**Workflow Location**:
- **Decision**: Export workflow instance from `workflow/core.py` and include in `agents/__init__.py` `export_entities()` list
- **Rationale**: Centralizes workflow definition in dedicated module while using standard DevUI discovery pattern
- **Alternative**: Export only from `workflow/` module (would require DevUI to scan multiple directories)

**Context Passing**:
- **Decision**: Rely on automatic context passing via `full_conversation` field in `AgentExecutorResponse`
- **Rationale**: 
  - WorkflowBuilder automatically handles context through `AgentExecutor.from_response()` handler
  - Each agent receives complete conversation history from workflow start
  - No manual message threading or state management required
  - Framework ensures no context loss between handoffs
- **Alternative**: SharedState with Pydantic models (could be added for structured data if needed, but not required for conversation-based workflow)

**Agent Names**:
- **Decision**: Use descriptive names: "EventCoordinator", "VenueSpecialist", etc.
- **Rationale**: Clear role identification in conversation history and DevUI
- **Format**: PascalCase for consistency

### System Prompt Design Principles

Each system prompt should include:

1. **Role Definition**: Clear statement of the agent's expertise and responsibilities
2. **Collaboration Context**: Awareness that the agent is part of a multi-agent workflow
3. **Input Expectations**: What information the agent should expect to receive
4. **Output Format**: Structured format for responses (bullet points, sections, etc.)
5. **Constraints**: What the agent should NOT do or assume
6. **Handoff Guidance**: How to conclude and hand back to coordinator

Example template structure:

    SYSTEM_PROMPT: Final[str] = """
    You are [Role Name], an expert in [domain].
    
    Your responsibilities:
    - [Responsibility 1]
    - [Responsibility 2]
    - [Responsibility 3]
    
    You are part of an event planning team. When you receive a request:
    1. [Step 1]
    2. [Step 2]
    3. [Step 3]
    
    Format your response as:
    [Expected format description]
    
    Constraints:
    - [Constraint 1]
    - [Constraint 2]
    
    Once you complete your analysis, provide your recommendations and indicate you are ready for the next step.
    """

### Workflow Architecture Notes

The workflow implements this sequential handoff pattern:

    User Input ("Plan a party for 50")
        ↓  full_conversation: [User]
    Event Coordinator (Initial Planning)
        ↓  full_conversation: [User, Coordinator]
    Venue Specialist (Research venues)
        ↓  full_conversation: [User, Coordinator, Venue]
    Budget Analyst (Allocate budget)
        ↓  full_conversation: [User, Coordinator, Venue, Budget]
    Catering Coordinator (Plan food)
        ↓  full_conversation: [User, Coord, Venue, Budget, Catering]
    Logistics Manager (Schedule)
        ↓  full_conversation: [All previous messages]
    Event Coordinator (Synthesize)
        ↓
    Integrated Event Plan

**Agent Handoff Mechanism**:

Each arrow (edge) in the workflow triggers this sequence:

1. **Source Agent Completion**:
   - Agent finishes processing with `agent.run(messages)`
   - `AgentExecutor` creates `AgentExecutorResponse`:
     - `agent_run_response`: Agent's raw output messages
     - `full_conversation`: All prior messages + agent's new outputs

2. **Edge Traversal**:
   - Framework routes `AgentExecutorResponse` to target agent
   - Uses WorkflowBuilder's edge definition: `add_edge(source, target)`
   - Framework automatically matches response type to handler

3. **Target Agent Reception**:
   - Target agent's `from_response()` handler receives response
   - Automatically loads `full_conversation` into message cache
   - Runs target agent with complete context from workflow start

4. **Context Accumulation**:
   - Each agent sees ALL previous messages (user + all prior agents)
   - No context loss between handoffs
   - Natural conversation flow maintained throughout workflow

**Why This Works**:
- `AgentExecutor.from_response()` is a built-in handler that accepts `AgentExecutorResponse`
- The framework automatically matches output type to input handler (type-based routing)
- No manual wiring, message transformation, or context management needed
- Conversation history grows naturally as workflow progresses

**Code Evidence**:
```python
# From agent_framework/_workflows/_agent_executor.py
@handler
async def from_response(self, prior: AgentExecutorResponse, ctx):
    \"\"\"Enable seamless chaining: accept prior AgentExecutorResponse as input.\"\"\"
    if prior.full_conversation is not None:
        self._cache = list(prior.full_conversation)  # Load complete history
    await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)  # Run with full context
```

### AgentExecutor Handoff Handlers

The `AgentExecutor` class (from `agent_framework`) provides multiple input handlers that enable flexible workflow composition. Understanding these handlers is crucial for workflow design:

**Primary Handler for Agent Chaining**:
```python
@handler
async def from_response(
    self, 
    prior: AgentExecutorResponse, 
    ctx: WorkflowContext
) -> None:
    \"\"\"Enable seamless chaining: accept prior AgentExecutorResponse as input.
    
    This handler is automatically invoked when an AgentExecutor receives
    an AgentExecutorResponse from a prior agent in the workflow.
    \"\"\"
    # Load full conversation history
    if prior.full_conversation is not None:
        self._cache = list(prior.full_conversation)
    else:
        self._cache = list(prior.agent_run_response.messages)
    # Run agent with complete context
    await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)
```

**Alternative Handlers for Workflow Start**:
```python
@handler
async def from_str(self, text: str, ctx: WorkflowContext) -> None:
    \"\"\"Accept raw user prompt string.\"\"\"
    self._cache = [ChatMessage(role=\"user\", text=text)]
    await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)

@handler
async def from_messages(
    self, 
    messages: list[ChatMessage], 
    ctx: WorkflowContext
) -> None:
    \"\"\"Accept list of ChatMessage objects as conversation context.\"\"\"
    self._cache = list(messages)
    await self._run_agent_and_emit(ctx)
```

**What This Means for Our Workflow**:
1. The start agent (`EventCoordinator`) uses `from_str()` or `from_messages()` for initial user input
2. All subsequent agents automatically use `from_response()` to receive prior agent's output
3. The framework automatically selects the correct handler based on message type (type-based routing)
4. No manual handler specification needed in workflow definition
5. Context passing is completely automatic via the `full_conversation` field

### System Prompt Design Principles

**Unit Tests** focus on:
- Workflow construction without errors
- Agent presence validation
- Edge definition validation
- No actual AI calls (fast, deterministic)

**Integration Tests** focus on:
- Full workflow execution with AI Foundry
- Real agent interactions
- Output validation
- End-to-end behavior
- Requires valid Azure credentials

**DevUI Validation** focuses on:
- User experience
- Visual workflow representation
- Real-time interaction
- Agent conversation flow
- Final output quality

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

These are NOT part of this specification but could be future work:

1. **Tool Integration**: Add tools for each specialist (venue search APIs, budget calculators, etc.)
2. **Shared State Models**: Pydantic models for structured data passing
3. **Parallel Execution**: Fan-out specialists for faster execution
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Add approval gates for budget or venue selection
5. **Memory Integration**: Use Mem0 for learning from past events
6. **Dynamic Routing**: Magentic-style orchestration based on task complexity
7. **Sub-workflows**: Make each specialist a mini-workflow
8. **Error Handling**: Retry logic, fallback strategies

## Interfaces and Dependencies

### Required Imports

In `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py`:

    from agent_framework.core import WorkflowBuilder, Workflow
    from spec2agent.clients import get_chat_client
    from spec2agent.prompts import (
        event_coordinator,
        venue_specialist,
        budget_analyst,
        catering_coordinator,
        logistics_manager,
    )

### Function Signature

    def build_event_planning_workflow() -> Workflow:
        """
        Build the multi-agent event planning workflow.
        
        The workflow orchestrates five specialized agents:
        - Event Coordinator: Primary orchestrator and synthesizer
        - Venue Specialist: Venue research and recommendations
        - Budget Analyst: Financial planning and allocation
        - Catering Coordinator: Food and beverage planning
        - Logistics Manager: Scheduling and resource coordination
        
        Returns
        -------
        Workflow
            Configured workflow instance ready for execution via DevUI
            or programmatic invocation.
        
        Notes
        -----
        The workflow uses sequential orchestration where the Event Coordinator
        delegates to each specialist in sequence, then synthesizes the final plan.
        
        Requires Azure AI Foundry credentials configured via environment variables
        or Azure CLI authentication.
        """

**Specification Version**: 1.2  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: In Progress - User Handoff Integration Added

---

## Specification Update Log

### Update 2025-10-27: Agent Handoff Mechanism Documentation
**Reason**: The original spec mentioned "conversation history" for context passing but didn't explain the technical mechanism. After deep research into Agent Framework source code, the automatic handoff mechanism via `full_conversation` field was discovered and documented.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Phase 2 - Workflow Pattern Decision**: Added detailed comparison of WorkflowBuilder vs HandoffBuilder, explaining when to use each
2. **Phase 4**: Renamed from "Shared State and Context" to "Understanding Agent Handoff in WorkflowBuilder"; replaced with technical explanation of `full_conversation` mechanism
3. **Step 2**: Added "Understanding the Handoff Flow" section showing step-by-step what happens during edge traversal
4. **Artifacts - Workflow Architecture Notes**: Expanded with detailed handoff mechanism explanation and code evidence from framework source
5. **Artifacts - New Section**: Added "AgentExecutor Handoff Handlers" documenting the built-in handlers (`from_response`, `from_str`, `from_messages`)
6. **Decision Log - D3**: Updated to clarify that conversation history passing is automatic via framework, not manual
7. **Decision Log - D5**: Added new decision documenting the research findings about `full_conversation` field
8. **Surprises & Discoveries**: Added detailed entry about discovering the automatic handoff mechanism with code evidence

**Research Conducted**:
- Analyzed `agent_framework/_workflows/_agent_executor.py` source code
- Examined `agent_framework/_workflows/_workflow_builder.py` for edge handling
- Reviewed `agent_framework/_workflows/_handoff.py` for HandoffBuilder pattern
- Studied samples in `third_party/agent-framework/python/samples/`
- Consulted DeepWiki documentation on agent handoff patterns

**Validation**:
- Current workflow implementation in `src/spec2agent/workflow/core.py` is correct
- Uses `add_edge()` which automatically triggers `from_response()` handler chaining
- No code changes needed - spec updated to match actual framework behavior
- Pattern validated against official framework samples

**Impact**: Spec now provides complete technical understanding of how agent handoff works in Agent Framework, enabling developers to confidently build multi-agent workflows with proper context passing.

### Update 2025-10-27: User Handoff / Human-in-the-Loop Integration
**Reason**: User handoff support was identified as a critical gap in the workflow. The initial implementation had no mechanism for agents to request user clarification, approval, or selection during execution. This update adds comprehensive human-in-the-loop capabilities using Agent Framework's native `RequestInfoExecutor` mechanism.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Progress Section**: Added new tasks for user handoff implementation
2. **Purpose / Big Picture**: Updated workflow description to mention user interaction capabilities
3. **Plan of Work - New Phase 6**: Added comprehensive design for human-in-the-loop integration
   - Background on Agent Framework's RequestInfoExecutor capabilities
   - Architecture using bidirectional edges to shared RequestInfoExecutor
   - Custom RequestInfoMessage type definitions
   - Workflow builder modifications
   - Agent prompt updates with user elicitation guidance
   - Testing strategy for user handoff scenarios
4. **Concrete Steps - New Step 6**: Added detailed implementation steps:
   - Creating RequestInfoMessage types
   - Updating workflow builder with RequestInfoExecutor
   - Updating agent prompts with user interaction guidelines
   - Creating tests for user handoff
   - DevUI validation procedures
5. **Decision Log - New D6**: Documented user handoff integration pattern decision
   - Rationale for RequestInfoExecutor with bidirectional edges
   - Alternatives considered (TurnManager, tool-based, hardcoded gates)
   - Implementation phases (prompt-based vs custom executors)
6. **Next Steps / Future Enhancements**: Marked "Human-in-the-Loop" as in progress

**Research Conducted**:
- Analyzed `guessing_game_with_human_input.py` sample for RequestInfoExecutor usage patterns
- Examined `workflow_as_agent_human_in_the_loop.py` for custom executor patterns
- Examined `azure_chat_agents_tool_calls_with_feedback.py` for DraftFeedbackCoordinator pattern
- Consulted DeepWiki documentation on human-in-the-loop workflows
- Studied RequestInfoMessage, RequestResponse, and RequestInfoEvent mechanisms
- Verified DevUI's automatic handling of RequestInfoEvent emissions
- Analyzed FunctionCallContent structure for tool call detection

**Design Approach**:
- **Tool-Based Detection**: Agents call `request_user_input` tool when they need user input
- **Custom Executor Wrappers**: HumanInLoopAgentExecutor wraps AgentExecutor to intercept tool calls
- **Framework-Native**: Leverages Agent Framework's built-in RequestInfoExecutor
- **DevUI-Integrated**: No custom UI needed, DevUI automatically handles RequestInfoEvents
- **Minimal Disruption**: Preserves existing sequential workflow structure
- **Single Message Type**: UserElicitationRequest with prompt, context dict, and request_type

**Key Benefits**:
- Enables agents to request clarification for ambiguous requirements
- Allows user approval/selection for critical decisions (venue, budget, menu)
- Maintains workflow autonomy (can run without user input if context is sufficient)
- Provides flexible, agent-driven user interaction rather than hardcoded gates
- Leverages DevUI's built-in support for human-in-the-loop workflows
- Tool-based approach ensures reliable detection of user input needs

**Implementation Status**: Design finalized; implementation pending

**Impact**: Transforms workflow from fully autonomous to interactive, enabling better alignment with user preferences and handling of ambiguous requirements. Addresses the core limitation identified in user feedback.
