## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Event organizers need a systematic, reliable way to plan and execute events of varying scales (from small meetups to large conferences). The system coordinates multiple specialized roles‚Äîplanning, venue research, budget analysis, and logistics‚Äîthrough a shared, validated artifact catalog. Each role follows standardized workflows with clear quality gates, ensuring consistent outcomes and enabling teams to extend the system safely as requirements evolve.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Small Meetup (20 attendees)
1. **Given** an EventBrief for a 20-person meetup with a fixed budget and single location preference  
   **When** the Event Planner defines scope, Timeline, and TaskRegister  
   **Then** the system produces a basic Timeline with minimum milestones and a TaskRegister with no resource conflicts

2. **Given** VenueCriteria specifying local venues with capacity for 20  
   **When** the Venue Researcher searches for venues  
   **Then** the system returns at least 5 VenueLeads and a VenueShortlist of at least 3 viable candidates within budget

3. **Given** a simple CostModel with basic categories  
   **When** the Budget Analyst develops the budget  
   **Then** the system produces a BudgetBaseline with variance ‚â§5% and all costs accounted for

4. **Given** a confirmed VenueShortlist and BudgetDecision  
   **When** the Logistics Coordinator creates the operational plan  
   **Then** the system generates a Schedule with no resource conflicts and a ResourceRoster

5. **Given** all artifacts validated and approved  
   **When** the lifecycle transitions from Confirm to Execute  
   **Then** the system produces a runbook with ContingencyPlan and ChangeLog, ready for execution

#### Scenario 2: Mid-Size Conference (200 attendees, multi-track)
1. **Given** an EventBrief for a 200-person conference with multiple session tracks and variable budget  
   **When** the Event Planner integrates resources, dependencies, and risks  
   **Then** the system produces a Timeline with critical path analysis, TaskRegister with dependencies, and RiskRegister with mitigation strategies

2. **Given** VenueCriteria for city center venues with capacity for 200 and multi-track layout  
   **When** the Venue Researcher evaluates venues  
   **Then** the system produces a VenueScorecard with weighted criteria, ranked shortlist, and availability checks with budget fit ‚â•95%

3. **Given** a detailed CostModel with multiple vendor contracts  
   **When** the Budget Analyst optimizes spend  
   **Then** the system identifies savings ‚â•10%, produces variance analysis, and maintains risk reserves ‚â•90%

4. **Given** complex vendor contracts and multi-venue options  
   **When** the Logistics Coordinator designs workflows  
   **Then** the system produces a LogisticsPlan with workflows linked to tasks, ChangeLog tracking all adjustments, and on-time task rate ‚â•95%

#### Scenario 3: Large Event (800 attendees, complex logistics)
1. **Given** an EventBrief for an 800-person event with tight timelines and multi-venue options  
   **When** the Event Planner performs strategic optimization  
   **Then** the system produces an optimized Timeline with contingency planning, CommunicationsPlan for multiple stakeholder audiences, and risk coverage ‚â•90%

2. **Given** VenueCriteria with complex requirements (accessibility, layout, multi-venue coordination)  
   **When** the Venue Researcher optimizes venue selection  
   **Then** the system produces a negotiation playbook, availability holds for at least 2 venues, and VenueNegotiationNotes with terms and concessions

3. **Given** multi-vendor contracts with cancellation risks  
   **When** the Budget Analyst assesses financial risks  
   **Then** the system produces a BudgetDecision with risk-adjusted reserves, hedging strategies, and contingencies for vendor cancellations

4. **Given** high-complexity logistics with potential high-impact incidents  
   **When** the Logistics Coordinator executes the runbook  
   **Then** the system resolves incidents in ‚â§15 minutes, triggers contingency plans for high-impact scenarios, and maintains resource utilization balance ‚â•80%

### Edge Cases
- What happens when VenueCriteria cannot be met within budget?
  - Venue Researcher flags budget mismatch, suggests alternative venues with trade-off analysis, and records decision in DecisionLog
  
- What happens when a vendor cancels close to the event date?
  - Budget Analyst and Logistics Coordinator collaborate via Multi-Agent pattern, trigger ContingencyPlan, update RiskRegister, and escalate to Event Planner with resolution options
  
- What happens when Timeline milestones slip beyond 10% threshold?
  - Event Planner escalates to stakeholders via Human-Agent interaction pattern, proposes mitigation options (resource reallocation, scope adjustment), and records decision with rationale
  
- What happens when required human approvals timeout?
  - System follows escalation paths defined in CommunicationsPlan, notifies backup approvers, and blocks workflow transition until approval received
  
- What happens when multiple agents produce conflicting constraints?
  - System records conflict in DecisionLog, presents resolution options with trade-offs via Multi-Agent pattern, and defaults to Event Planner as tie-breaker
  
- What happens when artifact schema validation fails?
  - System blocks task execution, requests specific missing fields, logs error with correlation ID, and notifies responsible agent
