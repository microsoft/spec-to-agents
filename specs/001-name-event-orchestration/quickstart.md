# Quickstart: Event Orchestration System (EODS) v0.1

## Goals
- Bootstrap local development
- Show how to authenticate to Azure resources with Managed Identity (or Azure CLI for local dev)
- Provide instructions for running tests and visual QA

## Prerequisites
- Azure CLI logged in (for local development): az login
- Docker (for local containers including ODBC Driver 18)
- Python 3.11, Node 18+, npm/yarn
- ODBC Driver 18 prerequisites (for Linux: unixODBC, msodbcsql18 packages)

## Local Development (with Azure CLI auth)
1. Clone repository and ensure you're on feature branch `001-name-event-orchestration`.
2. Start local DB emulator or point to Azure SQL using `az login` and `az account set --subscription <sub>`.
3. For local runs, set environment: export AZURE_AUTH_METHOD=azurecli (used by azure-identity's AzureCLICredential wrapper)
4. Start backend in dev mode (examples):
   - docker-compose up -d (build includes ODBC driver stage)
   - or: poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
5. Start frontend: npm install && npm run dev

## Running tests
- Backend: pytest -q
- Frontend: npm run test --workspace frontend (Vitest)
- Visual QA: Playwright test suite configured to run via Playwright MCP in CI

## CI and Managed Identity
- CI pipelines should use federated credentials or workload identity where possible to obtain tokens without storing secrets. Self-hosted runners may use managed identities attached to the host.

## Notes on ODBC and Containers
- Dockerfiles include linux packages for ODBC Driver 18; CI image builds should cache these layers.
- Provide a Windows-based CI job for environments that require native Windows ODBC drivers.
