# Feature Specification: Event Orchestration System (EODS) v0.1

**Feature Branch**: `001-name-event-orchestration`  | **Created**: 2025-09-26  | **Status**: Draft
**Input**: Provide a declarative, spec-driven way to define, validate, and run a multi-agent system that organizes events end-to-end. Standardize agent roles, shared artifacts, lifecycle workflows, interaction patterns, and testing so teams can implement consistently and extend safely.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an event organizer, I want a declarative, spec-driven orchestration system that generates and coordinates specialist agents so that planning, procurement, logistics, and execution are reproducible, auditable, and delivered within constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a submitted EventBrief for a small meetup (20 attendees), when the system runs the lifecycle, then Timeline, TaskRegister, BudgetBaseline, and Schedule are produced, approvals are requested where required, and the Execute phase completes with artifacts validated and a Postmortem produced.
2. Given a mid-size conference EventBrief (200 attendees) and a BudgetBaseline, when Venue Researcher and Budget Analyst produce their artifacts, then VenueShortlist, VenueScorecard, and a BudgetDecision are generated and human approvals are recorded in DecisionLog before Confirm.
3. Given a large, multi-track event (800 attendees), when Logistics Coordinator receives Timeline and BudgetDecision, then LogisticsPlan and ResourceRoster are produced, contingency triggers are defined, and on simulated vendor failure the contingency plan is executed and logged.

### Edge Cases
- Missing or incomplete EventBrief: agents MUST request specific missing fields and block downstream transitions until clarified.
- Conflicting constraints (date vs. venue availability vs. budget): agents MUST record conflicts in DecisionLog, present ranked alternatives, and escalate unresolved conflicts to the Event Planner.
- Vendor cancellations or contract breaches: Logistics Coordinator MUST update RiskRegister and trigger contingency procedures, and Budget Analyst MUST propose financial mitigations.
- Over-budget scenarios: Budget Analyst MUST produce reallocation options and surface required approvals; the system MUST not advance to Confirm until a BudgetDecision is approved.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST instantiate and coordinate the four specialist agents (Event Planner, Venue Researcher, Budget Analyst, Logistics Coordinator) according to the lifecycle states.
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain a shared artifact catalog (see Key Entities) that acts as the single source of truth for agent interactions; artifacts MUST be schema-validated before handoff.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement lifecycle workflow states and enforce preconditions for transitions: Initiate → Plan → Research → Budget → Logistics → Confirm → Execute → Postmortem.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support the declared interaction patterns (Single Agent, Multi-Agent, Human-Agent, Tool-Agent) with explicit gating, timeouts, and escalation paths for Human-Agent approvals.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide declarative instruction levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) for each agent, selectable per workflow run, and MUST execute the corresponding instruction_set semantics.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an artifact-level audit trail (ChangeLog, DecisionLog) for all decisions, approvals, and material changes.
- **FR-007**: System MUST expose testing harnesses for scenario-driven validation: unit tests for instruction_sets, contract tests for artifact schemas, integration tests for lifecycle flows, and end-to-end scenario tests (S-01..S-03).
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow tool adapters for calendar/scheduling, mapping/venue discovery, cost analysis, and communications, with a declared I/O contract and retry/fallback policies.
- **FR-009**: System MUST surface metrics and health signals (timeline_slippage, budget_variance, on-time_task_rate, incident_resolution_time) and support automated rollback/mitigation triggers when thresholds are breached.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support versioning and migration for artifact schemas and agent instruction_sets; breaking changes MUST include migration guidance and a compatibility plan.

## Non-Functional Requirements *(mandatory when applicable)*
- Observability: All task executions MUST emit structured logs, metrics, and traces with correlation ids; DecisionLog and ChangeLog MUST be queryable for audits.
- Performance: Orchestration decision-processing baseline: single-agent task p95 ≤ 2s; multi-agent collaborative flow p95 ≤ 5s. Timeline reconciliation and gating checks p95 ≤ 3s under normal load. These baselines are benchmarks to validate during early performance testing and may be adjusted.
- Availability: Orchestration control-plane availability target ≥ 99.9% (SLA for critical operations); fallback mode MUST allow read-only artifact access during partial outages.
- Security & Privacy: Artifact access MUST be controlled by RBAC; vendor/contract data MUST be stored encrypted at rest; secret keys MUST not be embedded in artifacts.
- Retention: DecisionLog and ChangeLog MUST retain critical audit entries for at least 1 year by default; retention policy MUST be configurable per deployment.
- Resilience: Tool adapters MUST declare retry and fallback semantics; on repeated failures the system MUST escalate to human approval flow.

---

## Constitution Check *(mandatory)*
- Code Quality: The feature mandates schema-validated artifacts, contract tests, and CI linting requirements for agent instruction_sets and adapters. Plans & PRs generated from this spec MUST include a Constitution Check mapping artifacts and tests to the Code Quality principle.
- Testing Standards: The spec requires test-first scenarios across instruction levels (unit, contract, integration, e2e). Each agent definition includes explicit testable assertions and scenario coverage (S-01..S-03).
- User Experience Consistency: UX acceptance criteria are required for user-facing artifacts and approval flows (e.g., BudgetDecision approval screens). Human-Agent patterns include timeouts and escalation paths ensuring consistency in approvals and errors.
- Performance Requirements: Per-agent metrics are specified (e.g., timeline_slippage, budget_variance) and orchestration baselines are provided in Non-Functional Requirements. Performance tests are required in CI for gating deployments.
- Observability & Versioning: Artifacts carry schema versions and correlation ids; ChangeLog and DecisionLog provide auditable trails; policy for semantic versioning of artifacts and migration notes is mandated.

- Decisions and changes are auditable in DecisionLog and ChangeLog.
- Postmortem produces actionable insights informing future runs and spec revisions.

---

## Testing Scenarios (examples)
- S-01 Small meetup: 20 attendees, single track, local venue, fixed budget — validate artifact generation, approvals, and on-time execution.
- S-02 Mid-size conference: 200 attendees, multi-track, city center, variable budget — validate multi-agent workflows, budget decisions and venue selection.
- S-03 Large event: 800 attendees, complex logistics, multi-venue options — validate contingency invocation, optimization, and scalability.

---

## Extension Guidelines
(Condensed) Define Agent Purpose, create instruction sets (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), implement agent classes conforming to capabilities and instruction sets, add tool adapters with explicit I/O contracts, and include testing across instruction levels.

---

## Governance
- Versioning: Artifact and agent instruction_set schema changes MUST be recorded with semantic versioning and migration notes.
- Data Contracts: All artifacts MUST be validated by schema before handoffs; failing validation MUST block transitions.
- Observability: Tasks MUST log start/end, status, correlation ids, and meaningful error contexts.
- Security: Access MUST be RBAC-controlled; vendor and contract data MUST be treated as sensitive.
