# Implementation Plan: Event Orchestration System (EODS) v0.1

**Branch**: `001-name-event-orchestration` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: C:\Users\alexlavaee\source\repos\spec-to-agents\specs\001-name-event-orchestration\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from C:\Users\alexlavaee\source\repos\spec-to-agents\specs\001-name-event-orchestration\spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (copilot)
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Create tasks.md with task generation approach and ordered TDD-first tasks
9. STOP - Ready for execution and CI integration

## Summary
A web-based orchestration platform that runs multi-agent event planning lifecycles (Initiate → Plan → Research → Budget → Logistics → Confirm → Execute → Postmortem) using agent-framework (AF) for orchestration and AI Foundry for agent creation. The design uses a FastAPI backend (Python 3.11), a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend, and a hybrid storage approach (Azure SQL for relational artifacts and CosmosDB for document-oriented artifacts). All Azure access will use Managed Identity / azure-identity (AzureCLICredential for local dev, ManagedIdentityCredential in cloud). MCP integrations (context7, playwright) are used for documentation discovery and visual QA respectively.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 + TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLModel, Omegaconf, pyodbc (ODBC Driver 18), httpx, agent-framework (AF), AI Foundry client libs, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Azure SQL (canonical artifacts, relational data), CosmosDB (documents, event artifacts)
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend), Playwright (visual QA)
**Target Platform**: Cloud-hosted web app (Azure App Service / Azure Container Apps / AKS) and local dev via Docker
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Per-agent decision-processing baseline: single-agent task p95 ≤ 2s; multi-agent collaborative flow p95 ≤ 5s; gating checks p95 ≤ 3s
**Constraints**: Zero secrets in code or config; all Azure access via Managed Identity/AzureAD tokens; ODBC Driver 18 required for pyodbc; CI/CD will run authenticated MCP integrations using Managed Identity where possible
**Scale/Scope**: Support workflows from 20 attendees (small) to 800+ (large); designed for 1K concurrent active runs at medium load

## Constitution Check
The plan explicitly maps design artifacts to the Spec-to-Agents constitution principles to ensure passable gates.

- Code Quality
  - Satisfying items: schema-validated SQLModel/Pydantic models (`data-model.md`), linting and formatting enforced via CI (ruff/ESLint), agent instruction_sets checked with contract tests in `/contracts`.
  - Mitigation (if any): New adapters will include a short design doc and contract tests; complex adapters will be isolated behind interfaces to limit blast radius.

- Testing Standards
  - Satisfying items: TDD-first tasks (see `tasks.md`) with failing tests committed prior to implementation; pytest/Vitest harnesses and Playwright scenarios for visual QA; contract tests auto-generated from `/contracts`.
  - Mitigation: Introduce CI coverage gates and require at least unit+contract coverage for agent-critical modules.

- User Experience Consistency
  - Satisfying items: Quickstart and UX acceptance criteria in `quickstart.md` and story-based integration tests (S-01..S-03) to validate flows; Timeout and escalation patterns are documented in `data-model.md` and `contracts`.
  - Mitigation: Any deviation from the design tokens/style guide must be submitted as a PR with explicit rationale and a short visual QA run.

- Performance Requirements
  - Satisfying items: Performance baselines documented above and included in `research.md` as targets; CI will include performance smoke checks for gating critical services.
  - Mitigation: If baselines are unmet, create a performance task to add instrumentation and optimization; fallbacks are defined for degraded read-only access.

- Observability & Versioning
  - Satisfying items: DecisionLog and ChangeLog designs in `data-model.md` include schema fields for correlation ids and versions; artifact versioning strategy and migration notes are in `data-model.md`.
  - Mitigation: If schema migration is required, the plan includes a migration task and a compatibility testing checklist.

## Project Structure
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/           # SQLModel / Pydantic models
│   ├── services/         # Orchestration services (AF adapters)
│   └── api/              # FastAPI endpoints and contract tests
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # React components, pages and UX flows
│   └── services/         # adapters for API and MCP integrations

**Structure Decision**: web app layout (backend + frontend), backend implements orchestration API and agent adapters; frontend implements quickstart UI, approvals, and visual QA dashboard.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. Extract unknowns from Technical Context: Managed Identity integration patterns for local CI, pyodbc + ODBC driver edge cases on Linux containers, AF/AI Foundry SDK specifics for agent lifecycle hooks
2. Research tasks will be produced and consolidated into `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Entities extracted and mapped to SQLModel/Pydantic in `data-model.md`
- API contracts (OpenAPI) produced in `/contracts`
- Contract tests scaffolded in backend `tests/contract/` to fail initially
- Quickstart steps in `quickstart.md` for local dev and cloud
- Agent context update: will run update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot to update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- Generate ordered tasks (TDD-first) from data model and contracts into `tasks.md`.
- Ordering strategy: tests → models → services → api → frontend. Prioritize agent instruction_sets and audit trails.

## Complexity Tracking
No known constitution violations. If any appear during Phase 1, they will be recorded here.
