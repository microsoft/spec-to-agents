# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Event Planning System

**Feature Branch**: `001-af-concurrent-workflows`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that helps users plan events. It can go from a user request to an agentic workflow that involves an event coordinator agent, budget analyst agent, venue specialist agent, catering coordinator agent, and logistics manager agent. The system implements user-handoff when needed to ask questions that come up or for more detail when needed."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to plan a comprehensive event (e.g., corporate conference, wedding, birthday party) but lacks the time or expertise to coordinate all the details. They describe their event vision in natural language, and the system orchestrates multiple specialized agents to collaboratively plan the event. When agents need additional information or clarification, the system pauses to ask the user specific questions before continuing.

**Example Journey**:
1. User submits: "I need to plan a company holiday party for 100 employees in Seattle in December, budget around $10,000"
2. Event Coordinator agent analyzes the request and delegates to specialized agents
3. Budget Analyst determines budget allocation across categories
4. Venue Specialist suggests suitable locations within budget and location constraints
5. System asks user: "Would you prefer a formal sit-down dinner or casual cocktail-style event?"
6. Based on response, Catering Coordinator recommends menu options
7. Logistics Manager creates timeline and coordination plan
8. User receives comprehensive event plan with venue options, catering proposals, budget breakdown, and timeline

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with no event plan, **When** they submit an event description with basic parameters (type, size, budget, location, date), **Then** the system orchestrates agents to produce a comprehensive event plan including venue options, catering suggestions, budget allocation, and logistics timeline.

2. **Given** an agent workflow in progress, **When** an agent needs clarification (e.g., dietary restrictions, event formality, specific preferences), **Then** the system pauses execution, presents specific questions to the user, and resumes workflow after receiving answers.

3. **Given** a user submits an incomplete request, **When** the system identifies missing critical information (e.g., no budget specified), **Then** the Event Coordinator agent asks targeted questions before delegating to specialized agents.

4. **Given** multiple agents working concurrently, **When** one agent completes its task (e.g., Budget Analyst finishes allocation), **Then** dependent agents (e.g., Venue Specialist, Catering Coordinator) receive the information and continue their work without user intervention.

5. **Given** a completed event plan, **When** the user requests modifications (e.g., "Actually, increase budget to $15,000"), **Then** the system re-orchestrates relevant agents to update affected components while preserving unaffected decisions.

6. **Given** a user views the event planning progress, **When** agents are actively working, **Then** the system displays real-time status of each agent's activity and workflow progress.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user provides conflicting requirements?** (e.g., "$5,000 budget for 200-person formal gala") → Event Coordinator identifies conflict and asks user to prioritize or adjust constraints.

- **What happens when no venues meet all criteria?** → Venue Specialist presents closest matches with trade-off explanations (e.g., "3 venues found, but all slightly exceed budget by 10-15%") and asks user for flexibility guidance.

- **What happens when user abandons conversation mid-workflow?** → System persists session state to database, allowing resumption for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, session expires but event plan drafts remain accessible.

- **What happens when an agent encounters an error or timeout?** → System notifies user of the issue, provides partial results from other agents, and offers to retry or continue without the failed component.

- **What happens when user submits an extremely vague request?** (e.g., "Plan something fun") → Event Coordinator engages in structured Q&A to gather minimum viable parameters before delegating.

- **What happens with simultaneous user sessions?** → System supports multiple concurrent users with isolated sessions. Each user's planning workflow is independent with no cross-session data sharing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Event Planning
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language event descriptions including event type, attendee count, budget, location, and date/timeframe.
- **FR-002**: System MUST orchestrate five specialized agents: Event Coordinator, Budget Analyst, Venue Specialist, Catering Coordinator, and Logistics Manager.
- **FR-003**: Event Coordinator agent MUST analyze user requests, decompose them into tasks, and delegate to appropriate specialized agents.
- **FR-004**: System MUST produce a comprehensive event plan including venue recommendations, catering options, budget breakdown, and logistics timeline.

#### Agent Coordination
- **FR-005**: System MUST support concurrent agent execution where tasks have no dependencies (e.g., Venue Specialist and Catering Coordinator can work simultaneously after Budget Analyst completes).
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce dependency ordering (e.g., Budget Analyst must complete before Venue/Catering agents receive budget constraints).
- **FR-007**: Budget Analyst agent MUST allocate budget across categories (venue, catering, logistics/supplies, contingency) based on event type and constraints.
- **FR-008**: Venue Specialist agent MUST recommend venues matching location, capacity, budget, and date availability criteria.
- **FR-009**: Catering Coordinator agent MUST suggest catering options (menu styles, dietary accommodations, service types) within budget constraints.
- **FR-010**: Logistics Manager agent MUST create event timeline including setup, event duration, teardown, and key milestones.

#### User Handoff & Interaction
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement user-handoff capability to pause workflow and ask clarifying questions when agents need additional information.
- **FR-012**: System MUST present user questions with clear context explaining why the information is needed and which agent is requesting it.
- **FR-013**: System MUST resume workflow immediately after receiving user responses, providing new information to waiting agents.
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to modify requirements mid-planning, triggering re-evaluation by affected agents.

#### Visualization & Progress Tracking
- **FR-015**: System MUST display real-time agent activity and workflow status (which agents are active, completed, waiting).
- **FR-016**: System MUST visualize agent collaboration patterns and information flow between agents.
- **FR-017**: System MUST show conversation history including user inputs, agent questions, and agent outputs.

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- **FR-018**: System MUST gracefully handle agent failures by notifying the user and providing partial results from successful agents.
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate user inputs for completeness and ask for missing critical information before starting intensive agent work.
- **FR-020**: System MUST detect and surface conflicting requirements to the user for resolution.

#### Session Management
- **FR-021**: System MUST maintain conversation context throughout the planning session.
- **FR-022**: System MUST persist planning session state to database to allow resumption after user disconnection for up to 24 hours.

### Non-Functional Requirements
