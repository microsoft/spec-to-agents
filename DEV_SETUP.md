## Running the Workflow

### Interactive CLI Mode (Recommended)

Run the event planning workflow with human-in-the-loop via command line:

```bash
uv run console
```

This starts an interactive session where you can:
- Enter an event planning request
- Provide feedback when agents need clarification or approval
- See the final synthesized event plan

Example interaction:
```
Enter your event planning request:
> Plan a corporate holiday party for 50 people on 6th December 2025 in Seattle with a budget of $5000

[Workflow executes...]

ðŸ¤” VENUE needs your input:
   Which venue do you prefer? (A/B/C)
   Your response > B

[Workflow continues...]

âœ“ FINAL EVENT PLAN
[Comprehensive plan output]
```

### DevUI Mode

Alternatively, visualize and interact with the agents using DevUI:

```bash
uv run app
```
