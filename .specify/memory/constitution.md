# Spec-to-Agent Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all code changes.**

All implementations MUST follow this strict sequence:
1. **Tests Written First**: Contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests are written before any implementation code
2. **Tests Must Fail**: Verify all tests fail with meaningful error messages before implementation begins
3. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Implement minimal code to pass tests, then refactor for quality
4. **No Untested Code**: Every function, endpoint, and component must have corresponding tests
5. **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for backend, 75% for frontend; critical paths require 100%

**Rationale**: TDD ensures correctness, prevents regression, improves design through testability constraints, and provides living documentation of system behavior. The Spec-to-Agent sample demonstrates Microsoft Agent Framework; reliability is non-negotiable.

### II. Code Quality Standards
**All code must meet consistent quality benchmarks to maintain long-term maintainability.**

**Type Safety (MUST)**:
- Python: Full type hints on all functions, methods, and class properties; mypy strict mode with no untyped defs
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled; no `any` types except when interfacing with untyped third-party libraries (must be documented)
- All public APIs must have complete type signatures

**Code Style (MUST)**:
- Python: Black formatting (line length 88), isort for imports, Ruff linting with configured rules
- TypeScript: ESLint configuration enforced, consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes)
- Maximum function complexity: Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10; functions exceeding this require refactoring or documented justification

**Documentation (MUST)**:
- All public functions, classes, and modules require docstrings/JSDoc with: purpose, parameters, return values, raised exceptions
- Complex algorithms require inline comments explaining the "why" not the "what"
- README files for each major module explaining architecture decisions

**Error Handling (MUST)**:
- No silent failures: All errors must be logged with appropriate severity
- User-facing errors must be actionable and clear
- Backend: Structured logging with context (request IDs, user IDs, timestamps)
- Frontend: User-friendly error messages; technical details in console for debugging

**Rationale**: Consistent quality standards reduce cognitive load, enable team velocity, prevent technical debt accumulation, and ensure the sample serves as exemplary reference code for Agent Framework users.

### III. User Experience Consistency
**User interactions must be intuitive, responsive, and consistent across the entire application.**

**Frontend Responsiveness (MUST)**:
- UI updates must occur within 100ms of user action for immediate feedback
- Asynchronous operations require loading states within 200ms
- Skeleton screens or progress indicators for operations exceeding 500ms
- No UI blocking during background tasks (agent orchestration, API calls)

**Design Consistency (MUST)**:
- Component library usage: All UI elements use established component patterns
- Spacing, typography, and color schemes follow design system
- Consistent interaction patterns: similar actions behave similarly across contexts
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

**Agent Visualization (MUST)**:
- Real-time agent status updates with visual indicators (thinking, responding, waiting)
- Group chat interactions displayed in chronological order with clear speaker attribution
- Agent decisions and reasoning visible to users for transparency
- Clear error states when agents encounter issues

**User Feedback (MUST)**:
- Success/error notifications for all user actions
- Form validation with clear, actionable error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Helpful empty states with guidance on next steps

**Rationale**: The Spec-to-Agent sample showcases Agent Framework's capabilities; poor UX undermines trust in the technology. Consistent, responsive interfaces demonstrate production-readiness and serve as a reference implementation for others.

### IV. Performance Requirements
**The application must deliver responsive performance under realistic loads to demonstrate production readiness.**

**Response Time Requirements (MUST)**:
- API endpoints: p95 latency < 200ms for non-LLM operations, < 5s for agent orchestration
- Page load time: First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Time to Interactive < 3.5s
- WebSocket latency: Message delivery < 100ms for real-time agent updates
- Database queries: Simple queries < 50ms, complex aggregations < 200ms

**Scalability Targets (MUST)**:
- Backend: Support 100 concurrent users in Azure Container Apps deployment
- Agent orchestration: Handle 10 concurrent event planning sessions
- Memory efficiency: Backend container < 512MB baseline, < 1GB under load; Frontend bundle < 2MB gzipped
- Connection pooling: Database connections limited and reused; HTTP client connection pooling enabled

**Resource Optimization (MUST)**:
- Frontend: Code splitting for routes, lazy loading for heavy components, optimized images (WebP, responsive sizing)
- Backend: Async/await for I/O operations, connection pooling, caching for repeated LLM prompts/responses
- Agent Framework: Efficient message passing, minimize redundant LLM calls through caching and prompt optimization

**Monitoring Requirements (MUST)**:
- Application Insights integration for telemetry, request tracking, and dependency monitoring
- Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD: Failed builds if bundle size or response times exceed thresholds
- Alerting on p95 latency degradation, error rate spikes, or resource exhaustion

**Rationale**: As a hero sample for Microsoft Agent Framework, performance demonstrates the framework's production viability. Poor performance would discourage adoption and misrepresent the technology's capabilities.

## Technology Standards

**Approved Technology Stack**:
- **Backend**: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, Microsoft Agent Framework (agent-framework-core, agent-framework-azure-ai)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript 5.8+, React 19, Vite 7
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Container Apps, Azure OpenAI, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Key Vault, Azure Application Insights
- **Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest/React Testing Library (frontend)
- **Package Management**: uv (Python), npm (JavaScript)

**Dependency Management (MUST)**:
- All dependencies pinned to specific versions or tight ranges in pyproject.toml and package.json
- Security vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline (dependabot, Snyk, or Azure DevOps equivalent)
- Regular dependency updates scheduled quarterly; critical security patches within 48 hours
- New dependencies require justification and approval (documented in PR description)

**Azure Integration Requirements (MUST)**:
- Azure SDK usage follows best practices: managed identity for authentication, async clients where available
- Secrets stored in Azure Key Vault, never in code or environment variables in source control
- Telemetry sent to Application Insights for centralized monitoring
- Infrastructure as Code using Bicep templates in `/infra` directory

**Rationale**: Standardized technology choices reduce complexity, ensure supportability, and align with Microsoft's cloud-first strategy. The sample must demonstrate best practices for Azure integration.

## Quality Gates

**Pre-Commit Gates (MUST PASS)**:
- All tests pass locally (run `pytest` for backend, `npm test` for frontend)
- Linting passes (Ruff for Python, ESLint for TypeScript)
- Type checking passes (mypy for Python, TypeScript compiler)
- No unresolved merge conflicts or debugging code (console.log, breakpoints)

**Pull Request Gates (MUST PASS)**:
- All CI/CD pipeline checks pass (tests, linting, type checking, build)
- Code coverage meets thresholds (80% backend, 75% frontend); no decrease in coverage
- At least one approval from code owner or designated reviewer
- All conversation threads resolved
- PR description includes: feature context, testing approach, breaking changes (if any), deployment considerations

**Release Gates (MUST PASS)**:
- All integration tests pass in staging environment
- Performance benchmarks met (response times, resource utilization)
- Security scan passes (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- Documentation updated (README, API docs, architecture diagrams if applicable)
- Migration scripts tested (if database schema changes)

**Constitution Compliance (ENFORCED)**:
- Test-First: PR must show tests committed before implementation in commit history
- Code Quality: Automated checks enforce formatting, linting, type safety
- Performance: CI/CD includes performance regression tests; alerts on degradation
- UX Consistency: Design review required for UI changes (screenshots in PR)

**Rationale**: Quality gates prevent defects from reaching production, ensure constitutional principles are enforced automatically, and maintain sample quality as a reference implementation.

## Governance

**Constitutional Authority**:
This constitution supersedes all other development practices, style guides, and informal agreements. When conflicts arise, constitutional principles take precedence.

**Amendment Process**:
1. **Proposal**: Any team member may propose amendments via pull request to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
2. **Discussion**: Amendments require discussion period (minimum 3 business days for minor, 7 days for major)
3. **Approval**: Amendments require approval from project maintainers (at least 2 approvals for minor, 3+ for major)
4. **Migration Plan**: Major amendments require documented migration plan for existing code
5. **Versioning**: Constitution follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**Version Semantics**:
- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removal, redefined non-negotiable rules)
- **MINOR**: Additive changes (new principles, expanded sections, new quality gates)
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes, wording improvements without semantic changes

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests must include constitution compliance statement in description
- Monthly audits of codebase for constitutional adherence; violations trigger remediation tasks
- New contributors must review constitution during onboarding; acknowledgment required

**Deviation Process**:
- Deviations from constitutional principles require explicit justification documented in PR
- Temporary deviations allowed for prototyping (must be marked with TODO and issue tracking remediation)
- Permanent deviations require constitutional amendment (not ad-hoc exceptions)

**Living Document**:
- Constitution reviewed quarterly for relevance and effectiveness
- Metrics tracked: constitutional violations per sprint, time to remediate, amendment frequency
- Retrospectives include constitutional effectiveness discussion

**Related Governance Documents**:
- Runtime development guidance: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot), `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), etc.
- Template specifications: `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, `tasks-template.md`
- Architecture decisions: Documented in `/docs/architecture/` (to be created as needed)
