# Spec-to-Agents Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Every contribution MUST meet the project's code quality standards. Non-negotiable rules:
- MUST pass static analysis and linters configured in CI before merge.
- MUST include readable, well-documented code with clear intent and bounded complexity.
- MUST include API documentation or docstrings for public interfaces.
Rationale: High code quality reduces review time, prevents regressions, and ensures long-term maintainability.

### II. Testing Standards
Testing is mandatory and MUST follow the Test-First discipline where feasible. Non-negotiable rules:
- MUST write automated tests for new behavior: unit tests for logic, contract tests for public interfaces, and integration tests for cross-service flows.
- Tests for new functionality MUST be committed before implementation and must fail initially (TDD pattern).
- CI MUST enforce a coverage baseline for critical modules and prevent merge on failing tests.
Rationale: Tests provide verifiability, enable safe refactors, and form the primary acceptance criteria for features.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User-facing behavior MUST be consistent across the product surface. Non-negotiable rules:
- UX acceptance criteria MUST be specified in feature specs for any user-visible change.
- Visual and interaction patterns MUST follow the repository's design tokens and style guide; deviations require explicit approval.
- Accessibility and error-handling flows MUST be addressed for new UI elements.
Rationale: Consistency reduces user confusion, improves accessibility, and preserves product trust.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Performance expectations MUST be defined and validated for all non-trivial components. Non-negotiable rules:
- Every feature with measurable user or operational impact MUST declare performance targets (e.g., latency p95, throughput, memory) in its spec.
- Performance tests or benchmarks MUST be included in the test plan and executed in CI or gating pipelines where feasible.
- Optimizations that add complexity MUST be justified with measurements and fallbacks.
Rationale: Explicit performance goals prevent regressions, guide implementation trade-offs, and ensure a reliable user experience at scale.

### V. Observability & Versioning
Systems MUST be observable and follow clear versioning practices. Non-negotiable rules:
- Services MUST emit structured logs, metrics, and meaningful traces for critical flows.
- Changes to public contracts MUST follow semantic versioning; breaking changes require a documented migration plan and MAJOR version bump.
- Rollouts MUST include monitoring for regressions and an automated rollback plan when thresholds are exceeded.
Rationale: Observability enables rapid incident diagnosis; consistent versioning protects integrators and downstream consumers.

## Non-Functional Requirements
All feature specs MUST document relevant non-functional constraints and targets. Minimum expectations:
- Security & compliance baseline (data handling, secrets management) MUST be declared when applicable.
- Memory and storage constraints, expected concurrency, and acceptable failure modes MUST be stated for system components.
- Performance targets (p95, p99, throughput) MUST be present for components that impact user experience or operational cost.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates
The following workflow and gates are mandatory for all code changes:
- Pull requests MUST include a checklist asserting compliance with core principles (code quality, tests, UX, performance, observability).
- Code review requires at least one approving review from a maintainer and verification that CI gates (lint, tests, security scanners) passed.
- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan, changelog entry, and a version bump according to the versioning policy below.
- Emergency fixes MUST be documented with the rationale and retroactively covered by tests.

## Governance
Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, one or more implementation notes, and approval by the repository maintainers. Amendment procedure:
1. Draft a pull request updating this file with a concise migration plan for any breaking changes.
2. Include tests, tooling updates, and template changes required to remain compliant.
3. Obtain approval from at least two maintainers; update the **Last Amended** date on acceptance.

Versioning policy (semantic rules):
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance or principle removals/renames, or policy changes that invalidate prior compliance.
- MINOR: Adding a new principle, a mandatory section, or material expansion of guidance.
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording corrections, or non-substantive refinements.

Compliance review expectations:
- All PRs that implement features or infra changes MUST include a short "Constitution Check" in the PR description describing how the change aligns with each applicable principle.
- The CI pipeline SHOULD include automated checks where possible (linters, unit test coverage, contract tests, basic performance smoke tests).
