## Agent Architecture Overview

This directory contains the implementation of specialized agents for the Microsoft Agent Framework reference system. Currently using placeholder agents during development, with plans to integrate the actual Agent Framework when available.

## Current Implementation Status

### Placeholder Agent System

## Agent Implementation Patterns

### Base Agent Structure
```python
class PlaceholderAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, instructions: str, tools: List[str] = None):
        self.name = name
        self.instructions = instructions
        self.tools = tools or []
    
    async def run(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Simulate agent response based on instructions and tools."""
        return f"[{self.name}] Response to: {message}\n\nInstructions used: {self.instructions[:100]}..."
```

    def __init__(self, difficulty: DifficultyLevel = DifficultyLevel.BEGINNER):
        instructions = AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS[AgentType.EVENT_PLANNER][difficulty]
        super().__init__("Event Planner", instructions, tools=["calendar", "budget", "venue"])
    
    async def plan_event(self, event_request: EventRequest) -> EventPlan:
        """Create comprehensive event plan based on request."""
        # Implementation using instructions and tools
