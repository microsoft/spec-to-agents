"""
Interactive CLI for event planning workflow with human-in-the-loop.

This module provides a command-line interface for running the event planning
workflow with real-time human feedback. It handles RequestInfoEvents and
prompts the user for input via stdin.

Pattern
-------
This follows the human-in-the-loop pattern from guessing_game_with_human_input.py:
1. Call workflow.run_stream() with initial prompt
2. Collect RequestInfoEvents during streaming
3. Prompt user for responses via input()
4. Call workflow.send_responses_streaming() with collected responses
5. Repeat until WorkflowOutputEvent is received

    Run the event planning workflow with interactive CLI human-in-the-loop.

    This function implements the main event loop pattern from
    guessing_game_with_human_input.py, adapted for event planning:

    1. Build the workflow with connected MCP tool
    2. Loop until workflow completes:
       - Stream workflow events (run_stream or send_responses_streaming)
       - Collect RequestInfoEvents for human feedback
       - Collect WorkflowOutputEvents for final result
       - Prompt user for input when needed
       - Send responses back to workflow
    3. Display final event plan
    4. MCP tool cleanup handled automatically by async context manager

    The workflow alternates between executing agent logic and pausing
    for human input via the request_info/response_handler pattern.
